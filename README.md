BNBToken contract is basic contract with all supporting contracts added in the file

BNBCrowdSale contract has the same functionality as the standard version plus whitelist and auto transfers, and pull mechanisms for refund rather than send. The Contact also doesnt make any token transfers until the buyer has been approved on the whitelist. The crowdsale contact has to be approved in the token to transfer the tokens from the owner before the whitelist approval will work.

BNBTeamWallet will freeze tokens in the wallet under the team members address for the determined amount of time
